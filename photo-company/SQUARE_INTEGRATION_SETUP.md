### 🚀 **How It Works Now:**

4. **Auto-verification** → Your app automatically verifies payment
5. **Download button appears** → Customer can download their photo

### ⚙️ **Square Dashboard Configuration Required:**

To complete the integration, you need to configure your Square payment link:

1. **Go to Square Dashboard** → Payment Links
2. **Edit your payment link** (the one with ID: iph7ZajA)
3. **Advanced Settings** → Enable "Redirect to a website after checkout"
4. **Set redirect URL to:**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/#search?payment=success&order_id={ORDER_ID}
   ```
   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

### 🧪 **Testing the Flow:**

2. Go to the Search section
3. Search for a session and select a photo
